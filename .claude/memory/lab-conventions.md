# Lab conventions — index

Conventions live in `instructors/context/conventions/`:

- [`common.md`](../../instructors/context/conventions/common.md) — writing conventions for both tasks and wiki
- [`tasks.md`](../../instructors/context/conventions/tasks.md) — task structure and design principles (`lab/tasks/`)
- [`wiki.md`](../../instructors/context/conventions/wiki.md) — wiki file structure and section patterns (`wiki/`)
